# CodeClan Python Project Week 5
## Solo project 6 days.

## The Brief

<blockquote>
Build an app to track someone's travel adventures.

## MVP

- The app should allow the user to track `Country`s and `City`s they want to visit and those they have visited.
- The user should be able to create and edit `Country`s.
- Each `Country` should have one or more `City`s to visit.
- The user should be able to create and delete `City`s.
- The app should allow the user to mark destinations as visited or not.

## Inspired By

Lonely Planet, Atlas Obscura

## Possible Extensions

- Add sights to see at the destination `City`s.
- Be able to filter `City`s based on whether they have been visited.
- Allow the user to search for a destination by city name, region, or continent
