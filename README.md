# CodeClan Python Project Week 5
## Solo project 6 days.

## The Brief

<blockquote>
Build an app to track someone's travel adventures.

## MVP

- The app should allow the user to track `Country`s and `City`s they want to visit and those they have visited.
- The user should be able to create and edit `Country`s.
- Each `Country` should have one or more `City`s to visit.
- The user should be able to create and delete `City`s.
- The app should allow the user to mark destinations as visited or not.

## Inspired By

Lonely Planet, Atlas Obscura

## Possible Extensions

- Add sights to see at the destination `City`s.
- Be able to filter `City`s based on whether they have been visited.
- Allow the user to search for a destination by city name, region, or continent
</blockquote>
  
In addition to the above, I also included the ability for the user to create 'Notes' to annotate travel destinations before, during or after their trip.

During this project I also took the oppertunity to become more fluent with CSS3.
  
## The Stack

The brief required a full stack application written using Python and the Flask framework and Jinja2 Templates.  The database is PostgreSQL connected to python with the psycopg2 library.

## The Process

The process began with planning using wireframes to get some idea of where the app was heading.  Class diagrams and user journies where then completed.  Being over eager I did not plan this project as diligently as I could of and, of course, this become one of the major learning points of the project.

Database tables and models followed.

## What I learned

While making some planning efforts I could have done better.  I learned that it is very difficult to code something that is not known.

As the first CodeClan project the learning points are too numerous to mention so here are but a few ...
- Managing a project
- Workflows & Git
- Importance of planning database tables and python models in detail
- Complex CSS / pretty front-end is difficult to balance while maintaining accessibility.
- Time management and estimating time needed (estimates are always wrong, double them twice :-) )

## What I would do Differently
